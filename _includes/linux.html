    <li><b>A spreadsheet program</b>
      <br>For this workshop you will need a spreadsheet program. LibreOffice comes
      preinstalled with several Linux distributions. If you don't already have it, use
      your package manager to install it: (e.g., <code>sudo apt-get install
	libreoffice</code> for Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions).
</ul>

<p>

<li><b>OpenRefine</b>
<br>OpenRefine (previously Google Refine) is a tool for data cleaning 
that runs through a web browser, and any browser -
Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Explorer - should work fine. 
You will need to download Google Refine and install it, 
and when you open it, it will run through the browser, but you don't need
an internet connection, and the data will all be stored on your computer.
<ul>
<li>Go to the OpenRefine <a href="http://openrefine.org/download.html">download 
page</a> 
<li>Click on <i>Linux kit</i> to download the install file
<li>Download and extract
<li>Type ./refine to start and Google Refine will then open in your web browser.
<li>If it doesn't open automatically, open a web broswer after you've started the program and go to the URL <code>http://localhost:3333</code> and you should see OpenRefine.
</ul>

<p>

<li><b>R</b>
<br>In the workshop, we will use RStudio. RStudio is a nice interface to the 
programming language R. To use RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio.
<ul>
<li>R is available through most Linux package managers. 
You can download the binary files for your distribution
        from <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/index.html">CRAN</a>. Or
        you can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu
        run <code>sudo apt-get install r-base</code> and for Fedora run
        <code>sudo yum install R</code>). 
<li>To install RStudi, go to the <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop">RStudio Download page</a>
<li>Under <i>Installers</i> select the version for your distribution.
<li>Once it's downloaded, double click the file to install it
<li>Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any error messages.
</ul>

<p>

<li><b>SQLite</b>
<br>
For this workshop we're going to use the Firefox SQLite Plugin. It works through
the web browser Firefox. 
<ul>
<li>If you don't already have Firefox installed 
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">install Firefox</a>
<li>Start Firefox      
<li>Go to the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/">plugin homepage</a>.
<li> Click the "Add Now" button.
<li> Click "Install Now" on the dialog that appears after the download completes.
<li> Restart Firefox when prompted.
<li> Select "SQLite Manager" from the "Tools" menu and it will open within Firefox
</ul>
</ol>
